# Bash-File-Testing
Given an excutable, test files from a to b, and an output extension, runs test a through b

Put this file in the directory with the executables and test files.
I recommend providing a Makefile in same folder.

This is the syntax.
./runTestFiles {executable} {test number start} {test number end} {OPT: file extension}
